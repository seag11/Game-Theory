GAME THEORY SIMULATION USING MASM

This program simulates a iterative game theory exchange based upon a decision matrix outlined in a 2004 study "The Name of the Game..."  During each round, each player may choose to cooperate or defect.  This was programmed in Microsoft Macro Assembly (MASM) using the Irvine library.
