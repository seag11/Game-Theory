GAME THEORY SIMULATION USING MASM

This program simulates a iterative game theory exchange based upon a payoff matrix outlined in a 2004 study "The Name of the Game..."   Each round, players must choose either to cooperate or defect.  This was programmed in Microsoft Macro Assembly (MASM) using the Irvine library.  Instructions on how to assemble and link the program can be referenced at http://kipirvine.com/asm/.
